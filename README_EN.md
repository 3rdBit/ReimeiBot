# ReimeiBot
## DEVELOPING INSTRUCTIONS 
本项目基于[Nonebot2](https://github.com/nonebot/nonebot2)，遵循[OneBot](https://onebot.dev)协议。  
ReimeiBot uses MIT license.   
## INTRODUCTION  
> Set sail, Dawn!
> Fly away, Meteor!
Standardization, customization, simplification, and portability are our hopes.
Hope ReimeiBot can also become such a Nonebot2 robot framework!
## HOW TO BUILD
Sorry, but ReimeiBot is based on an engine called Nonebot2.
The plugin importing method of Nonebot2 is hard for building an executable file.
